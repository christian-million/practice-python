#
# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.
# 
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
# 
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
#
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the
# elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes
# Write this [optional: in one line of Python] using at least one list comprehension.
# (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).
# 
# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python,
# but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets that I had not
# yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choose to use the original directive and read about
# the set command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and use at least one list comprehension in the solution.
# 
# Extra:
# 
# - Randomly generate two lists to test this

# Import Libraries
from random import randint

# Initialize Random lists using list comprehensions
a = [randint(1, 10) for i in range(randint(1, 10))]
b = [randint(1, 10) for i in range(randint(1, 10))]

# Convert List Comprehension to Set Comprehension
c = {i for i in a if i in b}

# Show user
print(c)
