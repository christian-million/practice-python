#
# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
# print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd
# number react differently when divided by 2?
# 
# Extras:
# 
# - If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
# - Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and
# one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num,
# tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
