#
# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.
# One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
#
# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number.
# And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
