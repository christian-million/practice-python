# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.
# 
# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.
# 
# Your program should output something like:
# 
# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
# }
