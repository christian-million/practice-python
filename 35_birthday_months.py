#
# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.
# 
# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.
# 
# Your program should output something like:
# 
# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
# }

# Import libraries
import json
from collections import Counter
import datetime

# 'with' opens a resource manager (google says better that using open() and close())
with open('practice-python/resources/tng_birthdays.json', 'r') as json_file:
    tng_birthdays = json.load(json_file)

# Converts the "m/d/y" strings to python dates, then extracts month (%b)
months = [datetime.datetime.strptime(i, '%m/%d/%Y').strftime('%b') for i in tng_birthdays.values()]

# Counter counts each value in a list
c = Counter(months)

print(c)
