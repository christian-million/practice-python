# Practice Python

In order to practice my Python skills, I've decided to attempt all of the exercises on the [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/) Website.

This is the `master` branch of the github repository, which just contains templates of all of the scripts and the prompt associated with each exercise.

The [`solutions`](https://github.com/christian-million/practice-python/tree/solutions) branch contains my solutions to the exercises.

# Goals

- Successfully complete each exercise 

- Complete the "Extras" if any

- Practice useful comments

- Use only the libraries referenced in the prompts
