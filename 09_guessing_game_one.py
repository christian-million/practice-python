#
# Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number,
# then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
# (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)
# 
# Extras:
# 
# 1. Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
# 2. Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
