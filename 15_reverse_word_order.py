#
# Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:
#   
# My name is Michele
#
# Then I would see the string:
#
# Michele is name My
#
# shown back to me.
