# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
# 
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary (http://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt).
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.
# 
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
